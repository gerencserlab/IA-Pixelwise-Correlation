# Image analysis pipelines for analysis neuronal proteinn aggregates
These pipelines use a combination of morphological segmentation, pixel classifier, intensity measurments and cross correlation analysis to quantify various spects of intracellular and intranuclear protein aggregates.  
[This repository](https://github.com/gerencserlab/IATemplate/) contains custom image analysis pipelines for Image Analyst MKII    

## List of pipelines
* [Measure intranuclear aggregates and stain intensities in nuclei and dendrites with Labkit segmentation](Measure_intranuclear_aggregates_and_stain_intensities_in_nuclei_and_dendrites_with_Labkit_segmentation.md)
* [Pixelwise correlation with segmentation](Pixelwise_correlation_with_segmentation.md)

## How to use
To open and edit *.ips (XML) Image Processing Pipeline files download [Image Analyst MKII for Windows](https://www.imageanalyst.net/downloads/?item=recent/imageanalystMKII64.msi).
1. Clone this git in Image Analyst MKII by Edit/Download and Manage Pipelines from GitHub. 
2. Press the "< > Code" button [above in this page](https://github.com/gerencserlab/IATemplate/) and copy the URL of this git.
3. Paste the URL in the URL field in the Connect to Git window in Image Analyst MKII.
4. Press Download.
5. The pipelines deposited here will appear in the middle section of the Pipelines main menu.
* Note: you may download individual pipelines and add them to the Documents\Image Analyst\My Pipelines
